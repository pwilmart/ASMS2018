# ASMS2018
Poster presented at 2018 San Diego ASMS meeting, Thursday #389

Explains how to match reporter ion intensities (typically summed into protein
totals) between multiple TMT experiments. Many study designs will exceed the
current capacity (11 channels) and multiple TMT experiments will be needed to
accommodate the samples.

The other repositories at github.io/pwilmart have many more details and cover
a wider range of isobaric labeling analysis topics than the poster. I will
be happy to answer any questions via email (wilmarth@ohsu.edu).
