# ASMS_2018

Poster presented at 2018 San Diego ASMS meeting, Thursday 389.

---

Explains how to match reporter ion intensities (typically summed into protein totals) between multiple TMT experiments. Many study designs will exceed the current capacity (11 channels) and multiple TMT experiments will be needed to accommodate the samples.

The poster file is *Wilmarth_ASMS_poster_2018.pdf* and there is a companion text file *walk_through_text.md* to provide some additional background details while reading the poster.

The other repositories at [**github.io/pwilmart**](https://github.com/pwilmart) have many more details and cover a wider range of isobaric labeling analysis topics than the poster. I will be happy to answer any questions via email (wilmarth@ohsu.edu).
